                    <p style="margin-top:20px;">“See a need, fill that need.” Magical words are those, great inspiration. A new leaf is born when the tree gets ample full of water. Leadership has played its role of ‘water’, and my seniors are the ‘tree’. Like-wise there are many new leaves around me, whose age equals mine. Some have ripened and some are on the way. When I was a beginner, my path to what I am now was unclear and confusing. I don’t know where to begin. I was requiring a platform to prove me. I even don’t know in what I have to prove. Then came the platform into light: “LEADERSHIP FOUNDATION”. I started with Prevesha in my first year. This helped me to sort my good friends and friends. I began to like it more as it gave me the practical approach to what I was studying back then. I had done many projects alongside of my seniors (Tutors) in my first year. This made me strong in my academics to learn anything practically. Next stage of my path is to transform knowledge to others. We began workshop on robotics and incubations. This helped me to improve my communication. We lost our fear to stand on stage first and lost our fear to speak next. The next stage where I am thankful to this platform is, it has exposed our skills to outer world by letting us to participate in various competitions in IIT’s, NIT’s and renowned Universities. We lost our fear of exposure here. At the end of the day what we have learnt here is to dream big, to think big, to plan big and to achieve big and to live big.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Leadership team stands as an example that can prove a journey to success. It is working with different platforms and trying to show the different dimensions for the technocrats. While talking about my self-experience rather I should start my journey from being the part of a member in the Robotics club at its Inception stage as a club. I learnt some basic concepts and understood the behavioural pattern and its theoretical contribution to ones intellect. I fondled it. When I elected as a chairman to the community I realized the background story and the hard work of my seniors and their thrust and urge to make us understand, relish our hidden technical skills and imbibe the methodologies of understanding technical prospectus. After taking the position as a chairman according to the designed points table and people’s choice I took an oath of improving the enhanced skills in an individual. This taught me a lesson of making Interdisciplinary projects and way of implementations to curb the student interest in developing a project model for their career. This made me to nullify the hardness level in my Technical projects. I developed my thesis to learn about the student integrity and his growth in the society accord to a linear development of progressive structure. Thus, Leadership encouraged me to study wilfully and not by forcefully and made me to enjoy the study and now I find the beauty of reading. This inspiration made me to choose my direction towards becoming a Civil Service Officer and extend my helping hand to my beloved teacher and my parents who always think to help society.</p>

It's not only filled with fun, excitement and enthusiasm but also the amalgamation of various kinds of self-motivating activities, which act as the backbone to excel in one's career. It is often believed that in order to see our country as a developed country, each and every citizen should be an all-rounder. That is the most thought provoking statement I have come across. LEADERSHIP plays a major role in enhancing the skills that are ought to be possessed by every student in order to be an all-rounder in life, and also it played a major role in my life to get placed in MNCs such as TechM. I'm very obliged to the Leadership eternally which supported me in making this happen.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:20px;">Leadership is a quality that innate in everyone but the fact is that the ability to have an impact on others with the same will make us to grow as a Leader. It is not just organizing events, making decisions and delegating tasks there is much beyond the known things. The goal of different programs is to support individuals to discover their true talents, passions and ambitions to turn those into concrete results. It means ensuring the vibrancy of the student body and stimulating the growth of incoming leaders. I have personally been very fortunate to have had many opportunities to develop my leadership skills and be provided with opportunities to exhibit as well. This has given me tremendous exposure to new opportunities and accelerated my growth as a leader. In my opinion, everyone strives for acknowledgement and acceptance, and when you get it, the worst problem suddenly seems surmountable. And today these integrated experiences made me to act as a good team player in the Company. Finally I would like to give a word “You can't lead anyone if you can't lead yourself first.” Listen to your passion and pay attention to it.</p>
